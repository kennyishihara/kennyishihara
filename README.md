## Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kenny, a data scientist working on building an end-to-end MLOps solution. Scala and Python are my go-to languages for work, but currently learning about Rust for its low-level capabilities.

### Hobbies

- Learning about practical applications of AI
- Creating Command Line Applications
- Benchmarking stuff (mostly admiring how fast Rust apps can be compared to Scala and Python)
