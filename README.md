## Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kenny, a data scientist working on building AI products around Generative AI in the media industry. Scala and Python are my go-to languages for work, but currently learning about Rust for its low-level capabilities.

### Interests

- Building scalable programs
- Practical applications of AI
- Command Line Applications
- Benchmarks (mostly admiring how fast Rust apps can be compared to Scala and Python)
- Privacy and Security
